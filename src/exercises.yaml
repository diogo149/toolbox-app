    # Reclamation of Projection

    1. P1 picks a thought that limits their belief of what could be possible

    2. P2 just ask (mostly how/what) questions about it, without believing their story

    3. Switch after

    ### Some tools for P2:
    1. deconstruction (question the assumption)
      - define it
      - prove it
      - relativity
      - root cause
      - logical inconsistency
      - when in deconstruction, you aren't in VIEW because you are partial (you want to deconstruct the belief)

    2. rabbit hole ("what's wrong with _?")
      - all fear has a false end. this helps see through that.
      - use the same words they use
      - problem: it might be circular
        - ask then to not define it in terms of itself
        - if you get stuck deconstruct
        - sometimes you can figure out what it is you don't want to feel

    3. polarity
      - looking for something that has constriction
      - you want to look for a double bind (fucked if you do, fucked if you don't)
      - it should be personal (I want to make money and that's okay - money is unimportant to me and that's okay) (I can't get out of my head - I don't think things through)
      - it should be personal (use "I" etc.)

    4. externalize ("would you say that to a six-year old")
      - taking their isolation and changing it
      - could be taking it to the general public, a loved one (mother, friend, child, etc), famous figure (ghandi, mother Teresa, etc), someone else in the room
      - "what makes it ok/not ok for them but ok/not ok for you?"
      - the point is how gentle are you to others and are you that gentle to yourself
      - to get a perspective on how we're treating ourselves

    5. thermostat
      - have P1 say "_, and it's ok"

    # Emotional Surfing and Journaling

    Altenate between journaling and a basic surf:

    ### Basic Surf
      1. close your eyes
      2. notice 2-3 distinct sensations
      3. feel all your sensations tile the wave subsides (or 60-90 seconds)

    ### Journaling:
      1. write things to have wave of emotion start, things don't have to make sense
      2. when they start, stop journaling and do basic surf
      3. go into body and let go of cognition
      4. when done with wave, open eyes and start writing again

    ### Tips:
      - avoid: thinking about what we're feeling when not writing
      - if thinking, bring attention back to your body
